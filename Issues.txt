# Issues

1. Use a GenomeFactory and GeneFactory paradigm to control Organism attributes

2. Remove Painter as a global variable 
    a. HIDDEN DEPENDENCY!!!
    b. Will be required once the code base grow large enough

3. Store a list of Overlaps in Organism
    a. may not be required because handling collisions of two bodies ata time seems enough

4. Implement shape accurate collision detection
    a. Currently all overlap detection is based on a bounding rect
    b. Reference: http://jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/circle-rect.php

5. Javafy files: Related to issue 2

6. Mutation: Blocked by 1

7. Sexual reproduction: Blocked by 1

8. Movement modes for each species: Blocked by 1
