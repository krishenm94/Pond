# Issues

1. Use a GenomeFactory and GeneFactory paradigm to control Organism attributes

2. Remove Painter as a global variable 
    a. HIDDEN DEPENDENCY!!!
    b. Will be required once the code base grow large enough

3. Store a list of Overlaps in Organism
    a. may not be required because handling collisions of two bodies ata time seems enough
